- Edit user, add user, delete user functions available in User List page.
- Username cannot be change because of used to login. Also changing the password is not allowed.
- Admin can't change user roles and can't list other admins. When admin create a user, user's role will be Customer by the default. Also Admin can delete only customers.
- Super Admin can update role and can list all users.
- Super Admin can't delete itself, but can delete other Super Admin's accounts.
- Everyone can login or register to application. But if logged user try to reach Login or Register page will be redirect to Home page. Login and Register pages protected by `NotLoginGuard (Router-Guard)`.
- This app uses `JSON Server` for creating fake database and `JSON Server Auth` to manage login - register operations. By the way auth token has 1 hour life time.

## About Application

- Created with Angular v13
- Uses Angular Material Framework for app compoments
- CSS template engine is SCSS
- Bootstrap Reboot, Bootstrap Grid, Bootstrap Tables and Bootsrap Aler imported with Sass
- Ngx Cookie Service used to handle cookies
- User ids gererated with uuid
- concurrently used to run multiple script commands in same time

## TO DO

- NGRX should be use to state managament
- Usualy i use `toPromise()` for converting observables to promise then use in async functions with await. I think it make codes more readable and avoid problems like cold observale and unsubscribe. Now `toPromise()` is depraced, need to find new method instead of it.
